# -Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-pipeline
Create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation  pipeline that allows users to upload documents and  ask questions based on their content. The system should leverage vector databases for efficient retrieval  and an LLM API for generating responses. The entire  application should be containerized using Docker and deployable on cloud or local environments.
